## Manuscript Overview

**Title**: *Predicting Adolescentsâ€™ Future Smoking Behavior through Anti-Smoking Ad Exposure*\
**Methodology**: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior\
**Dataset**: Monitoring the Future (MTF) 2023 Survey\
**Sample**: \~14,000 U.S. adolescents (Grades 8 & 10)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Findings

-   Anti-smoking ads significantly influence adolescent beliefs through attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control
-   High internal consistency across TPB constructs (AVE \> 0.50, CR \> 0.89)
-   PBC emerged as the **strongest predictor** of intention to smoke

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SEM Constructs

The following psycho-cognitive variables were modeled using SEM:

| Construct | Description                         |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **ATT**   | Attitude toward smoking             |
| **INJ**   | Injunctive Norms                    |
| **DES**   | Descriotive Norms                   |
| **PBC**   | Perceived Behavioral Control        |
| **INT**   | Intention for Future Smoking        |
| **SMK**   | Current Smoking Status              |
| **ADS**   | Anti-Smoking Advertisement Exposure |
