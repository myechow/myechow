    "text": "Introduction\nThe prevalence of cigarette smoking among adolescents in the U.S. is the lowest in any other past years, yet more than 8.1% still reported using tobacco products. Despite a downward trend in recent years, approximately 472,000 middle school and 729,000 high school students reported current cigarette use, highlighting the need for ongoing prevention initiatives. Utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior, this study evaluates the impact of exposure to anti-smoking advertisements on adolescents‚Äô psycho-cognitive factors‚Äîspecifically attitudes, social norms, perceived control, intentions, and smoking behavior. The findings aim to inform individuals about more effective and accessible public health interventions as part of the ‚Äúsmoke-free future‚Äù initiative."

Instead, adolescents‚Äô risk perceptions toward tobacco use, perceived peer disapproval, estimate of peer smoking, and confidence in resisting smoking were stronger predictors of both current behavior and future intentions. Demographic factors, including parental presence, race, gender, and grade, significantly influenced adolescents‚Äô smoking-related perceptions and behaviors."

Data Preparation\n\nRecoding Software: SAS.\nVariables:\n\nAnti-Smoking Ad Exposure: Created from V7701 and V7702 to reflect recent ad exposure as a binary indicator.\nDescriptive Norms: Reverse-coded to indicate lower perceived peer smoking.\nParental Presence: Created by combining V7206 and V7207.\n\nItem Classification: All ordinal indicators were treated as categorical in Mplus.\nMissing Data: Addressed using pairwise deletion during CFA and SEM analyses.\n\n\n\n\n6.

    "text": "Introduction\nThe prevalence of cigarette smoking among adolescents in the U.S. is the lowest in any other past years, yet more than 8.1% still reported using tobacco products. Despite a downward trend in recent years, approximately 472,000 middle school and 729,000 high school students reported current cigarette use, highlighting the need for ongoing prevention initiatives. Utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior, this study evaluates the impact of exposure to anti-smoking advertisements on adolescents‚Äô psycho-cognitive factors‚Äîspecifically attitudes, social norms, perceived control, intentions, and smoking behavior. The findings aim to inform individuals about more effective and accessible public health interventions as part of the ‚Äúsmoke-free future‚Äù initiative."

    "text": "Results\nAd exposure showed minimal direct effects on psycho-cognitive predictors of smoking. Instead, adolescents‚Äô risk perceptions toward tobacco use, perceived peer disapproval, estimate of peer smoking, and confidence in resisting smoking were stronger predictors of both current behavior and future intentions. Demographic factors, including parental presence, race, gender, and grade, significantly influenced adolescents‚Äô smoking-related perceptions and behaviors."

The findings emphasized the significance of involving peer and family influences in prevention strategies. SEM highlights the complex behavioral pathways involved, offering evidence-based recommendations for strengthening early, family-centered interventions to promote a smoke-free future generation."
