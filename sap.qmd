## Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)

1.  Study Objective

    To evaluate whether exposure to anti-smoking advertisements influences adolescents’ psycho-cognitive factors, specifically attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, and, through them, affects behavioral intentions and current smoking behavior.

2.  Study Design

    • Design Type: Cross-sectional, observational.

    • Data Source: 2023 Monitoring the Future (MTF) Public-Use Dataset for 8th and 10th grade students.

    • Sampling Method: Multistage stratified random sampling.

3.  Hypotheses

    • Null Hypothesis (H₀): Anti-smoking advertisements have no direct or indirect effect on adolescents’ smoking intentions or behavior, and do not significantly influence psycho-cognitive factors such as attitudes, subjective norms, or perceived behavioral control.

    • Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Anti-smoking advertisements influence adolescents’ intentions and behavior directly and indirectly by shaping psycho-cognitive factors.

4.  Variables

    Latent Constructs: Attitudes (ATT) att1, att2, att3 Risk perception measured using a 4-point Likert scale. Injunctive Norms (INJ) inj1, inj2, inj3 Perceived peer disapproval measured on a 3-point scale. Descriptive Norms (DES) des1, des2, des3 Perceptions of peer smoking prevalence and pressure. Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) pbc Self-efficacy to resist smoking, measured with a single item. Intention (INT) int Likelihood of smoking in five years, measured on a 4-point scale. Advertisement Exposure (ADS) ads Binary indicator for exposure to anti-smoking ads. 4.2 Observed Outcome • Smoking Behavior (SMK): Binary indicator of cigarette uses in the past 30 days (0 = No, 1 = Yes). 4.3 Covariates • Gender (male, female). • Grade level (8th grade = 0, 10th grade = 1). • Race/ethnicity (White as reference category, Black, Hispanic). • Parental presence (neither, father only, mother only, both parents).

5.  Data Preparation

    1.  Recoding Software: SAS.

    2.  Variables:

        1.  Anti-Smoking Ad Exposure: Created from V7701 and V7702 to reflect recent ad exposure as a binary indicator.

        2.  Descriptive Norms: Reverse-coded to indicate lower perceived peer smoking. o Parental Presence: Created by combining V7206 and V7207.

        3.  Item Classification: All ordinal indicators were treated as categorical in Mplus.

        4.  Missing Data: Addressed using pairwise deletion during CFA and SEM analyses.

6.  Analytical Methods

    1.  Software Platform: Mplus Version 8.9.

    2.  Estimator: Weighted Least Squares with Mean and Variance (WLSMV).

    3.  Analysis Plan:

        1.  Step 1: Descriptive Statistics: Generate frequency tables for all model variables and demographic characteristics.

        2.  Step 2: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) • Evaluate the measurement model for ATT, INJ, and DES constructs. • Model Fit Criteria: o CFI ≥ 0.95 o TLI ≥ 0.95 o RMSEA ≤ 0.06 o SRMR ≤ 0.08.

            1.  Construct Validity Criteria:

                1.  Standardized factor loadings ≥ 0.50.

                2.  Composite Reliability (CR) \> 0.70 o Average Variance Extracted (AVE) \> 0.50.

        3.  Step 3: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)

            1.  Estimate path coefficients for:

                1.  Direct and indirect effects of ad exposure on intention and behavior.

                2.  Relationships between psycho-cognitive predictors and outcomes.

                3.  Associations between demographic variables and constructs.

        4.  Model Fit: Reassess fit indices for the full structural model.

        5.  Explained Variance (R²): Calculate the proportion of variance explained for both latent and observed variables. 6.3 Ethical Considerations.

        6.  This study uses publicly available, de-identified data and does not require IRB approval. • The research complies with MTF and ICPSR data use agreements.

        7.  All references follow AMA 11th edition guidelines.

        8.  AI was used only for editorial assistance, and results were validated independently.

7.  Conclusion:

    This Statistical Analysis Plan outlines a theory-based, methodologically sound framework to examine how anti-smoking advertisement exposure influences adolescent smoking behavior. The use of validated constructs, robust modeling techniques, and national survey data supports the study’s goal of informing targeted public health interventions.
