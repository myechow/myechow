## Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)

**1. Study Objective**

To evaluate whether exposure to anti-smoking advertisements influences adolescents’ psycho-cognitive factors, specifically attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, and, through them, affects behavioral intentions and current smoking behavior.

**2. Study Design**

-    **Design Type:** Cross-sectional, observational.

-    **Data Source:** 2023 Monitoring the Future (MTF) Public-Use Dataset for 8th and 10th grade students.

-    **Sampling Method:** Multistage stratified random sampling.

**3. Hypotheses**

-   **Null Hypothesis (H₀):**\
    Anti-smoking advertisements have no direct or indirect effect on adolescents’ smoking intentions or behavior, and do not significantly influence psycho-cognitive factors such as attitudes, subjective norms, or perceived behavioral control.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**\
    Anti-smoking advertisements influence adolescents’ intentions and behavior directly and indirectly by shaping psycho-cognitive factors.

**4. Variables**

4.1 Latent Constructs

+------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Construct**                      | **Indicators**   | **Description**                                                    |
+------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Attitudes (ATT)                    | att1, att2, att3 | Risk perception measured using a 4-point Likert scale.             |
+------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Injunctive Norms (INJ)             | inj1, inj2       | Perceived peer disapproval measured on a 3-point scale.            |
+------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Descriptive Norms (DES)            | des1, des2       | Perceptions of peer smoking prevalence and pressure.               |
+------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) | pbc              | Self-efficacy to resist smoking, measured with a single item.      |
+------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Intention (INT)                    | int              | Likelihood of smoking in five years, measured on a 4-point scale.  |
+------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Advertisement Exposure (ADS)       | ads              | Binary indicator for exposure to anti-smoking ads.                 |
+------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

**4.2 Observed Outcome**

-   **Smoking Behavior (SMK):**\
    Binary indicator of cigarette uses in the past 30 days (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

**4.3 Covariates**

-   Gender (male, female).

-   Grade level (8th grade = 0, 10th grade = 1).

-   Race/ethnicity (White as reference category, Black, Hispanic).

-   Parental presence (neither, father only, mother only, both parents).

**5. Data Preparation**

-   **Recoding Software:** SAS.

-   **Variables:**

    -   Anti-Smoking Ad Exposure: Created from V7701 and V7702 to reflect recent ad exposure as a binary indicator.

    -    Descriptive Norms: Reverse-coded to indicate lower perceived peer smoking.

    -    Parental Presence: Created by combining V7206 and V7207.

-   **Item Classification:** All ordinal indicators were treated as categorical in Mplus.

-    **Missing Data:** Addressed using pairwise deletion during CFA and SEM analyses.

**6. Analytical Methods**

**6.1 Software**

-   **Platform:** Mplus Version 8.9.

-   **Estimator:** Weighted Least Squares with Mean and Variance (WLSMV).

**6.2 Analysis Plan**

**Step 1: Descriptive Statistics**

-   Generate frequency tables for all model variables and demographic characteristics.

**Step 2: Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)**

-   Evaluate the measurement model for ATT, INJ, and DES constructs.

-   **Model Fit Criteria:**

    -   CFI ≥ 0.95

    -    TLI ≥ 0.95

    -    RMSEA ≤ 0.06

    -    SRMR ≤ 0.08

-   **Construct Validity Criteria:**

    -    Standardized factor loadings ≥ 0.50

    -    Composite Reliability (CR) \> 0.70

    -    Average Variance Extracted (AVE) \> 0.50

**Step 3: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)**

-   Estimate path coefficients for:

    -    Direct and indirect effects of ad exposure on intention and behavior.

    -    Relationships between psycho-cognitive predictors and outcomes.

    -    Associations between demographic variables and constructs.

-   **Model Fit:** Reassess fit indices for the full structural model.

-   **Explained Variance (R²):** Calculate the proportion of variance explained for both latent and observed variables.

**6.3 Ethical Considerations**

-    This study uses publicly available, de-identified data and does not require IRB approval.

-    The research complies with MTF and ICPSR data use agreements.

-    All references follow AMA 11th edition guidelines.

-    AI was used only for editorial assistance, and results were validated independently.

**7. Conclusion**

This Statistical Analysis Plan outlines a theory-based, methodologically sound framework to examine how anti-smoking advertisement exposure influences adolescent smoking behavior. The use of validated constructs, robust modeling techniques, and national survey data supports the study’s goal of informing targeted public health interventions.
