## Manuscript Overview

**Title**: *Predicting Adolescentsâ€™ Future Smoking Behavior through Anti-Smoking Ad Exposure*\
**Methodology**: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) grounded in the Theory of Planned Behavior\
**Dataset**: Monitoring the Future (MTF) 2023 Survey\
**Sample**: \~14,000 U.S. adolescents (Grades 8 & 10)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Findings

-   Anti-smoking ads significantly influence adolescent beliefs through attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control

-   High internal consistency across TPB constructs (AVE \> 0.50, CR \> 0.89)

-   PBC emerged as the strongest predictor of intention to smoke

-   Strong Internal Consistency for all Latent Constructs (psychometrically strong and have great internal alignment).

    -   Attitudes (ATT): CR = 0.93, AVE = 0.82.
    -   Injunctive Norms (INJ): CR = 0.94, AVE = 0.59.
    -   Descriptive Norms (DES): CR = 0.89, AVE = 0.53.

-   ADS â†’ INT: Unexpected negative Î² = â€“0.283

    -   Adolescents may exhibit message resistance or psychological reactance when they reject academic content perceived as controlling or become desensitized due to repeated exposure.

-   PBC â†’ SMK: Unexpected positive Î² = 0.556

    -   Adolescents often overestimate their ability to resist smoking, resulting in overconfidence or cognitive dissonance.

-   Demographic Insigths:

    |  |  |
    |------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
    | **Males** have lower ATT, INT, but higher PBC and DES than females. | **Parental presence**: higher ATT, DES, and ADS. |
    | **10th Grade**: higher ATT, INT, SMK. | **8th Grade**: lower DES and PBC. |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## SEM Constructs

The following psycho-cognitive variables were modeled using SEM:

| Construct | Description                         |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **ATT**   | Attitude toward smoking             |
| **INJ**   | Injunctive Norms                    |
| **DES**   | Descriptive Norms                   |
| **PBC**   | Perceived Behavioral Control        |
| **INT**   | Intention for Future Smoking        |
| **SMK**   | Current Smoking Status              |
| **ADS**   | Anti-Smoking Advertisement Exposure |
